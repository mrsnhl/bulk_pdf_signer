Open your PVF in Google Docs, fill the constants and the variables using the naming $$1 for name, $$2 for Roll No and $$3 for Signature and then download it as HTML from the File Tab. Rename it to Signed_PVF.html and replace that with the one here. 

Haven't added support for images yet - anyone is open do that and open a Pull Request.
